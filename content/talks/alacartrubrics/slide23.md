- Student's constraint was "design for a single person"
- They chose 'Benjamin Neyinyahou'
- It's not a project I am the best person to advise! 
- The solution is in the structure of the course - the group did research. One did research on games for change, referencing Brenda Romero's 'Train' and others, for example.

What I can do is facilitate resources. In this case, connections to other faculty and peers.
