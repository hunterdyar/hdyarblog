Lastly, it's not fair to *just* ask students for ideas.

We have to spend time talking about interesting projects, why they are interesting. Show them cool things, take them to field trips to museums, so on. You don't get great ideas for free, but by building up a collaborative studio atmosphere.

I mentioned the students don't actually get much freedom. Project decisions are a collaborative process, aided by in-class brainstorming exercises. In those sessions, it's pretty easy to say "Cool Idea, but not enough x. What about y?", and they'll start thinking.
