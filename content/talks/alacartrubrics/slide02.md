Hi, I'm Hunter Dyar. 

I have never given a quiz or a test before in my life! I teach almost exclusively project-based courses.

I cut my teeth working at summer camps, teaching Photography and Photoshop and Minecraft to students aged 7-17. So I have a lot of experience with project-based learning and keeping an active classroom.

I've taught 8 summers of tech camp, been an adjunct since 2015 (I think) for about 2 workshops a semester at CMU, and been full-time teaching at Chatham since Fall 2019.

In my decade+ of experience, almost everything I have ever taught has been built around projects.
