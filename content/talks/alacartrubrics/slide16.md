Feedback is the heart of the class sessions.

I'm also teaching students how to give solid and effective feedback. This is an important objective for us, and really propels the students as designers.

That enables the hack for large class sizes, or days when *everyone* did a prototype rubric. Split them into related groups, and have them give each other project feedback. Take quicker laps in order to evaluate everyone, without the entire burden of feedback.

Outside of feedback, the other part of class is the project selection time, that I call brainstorming sessions, and mini-lectures!
