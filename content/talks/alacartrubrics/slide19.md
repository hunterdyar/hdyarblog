I've never had a major conflict between a students desire and their reality. This, I feel, is because I never play antagonist or assigner. I don't, grammatically, give them something to conflict against.

Instead, we just have a discussion. Remember those personal learning objectives the students wrote down? 

Those are my ammunition throughout the rest of the class. Talk about their project... and to redirect a student, I'll just casually mention their learning objectives and a *hypothetical* way they might get there... and they tend to agree!

If you are going to steal one thing, it's asking students this question: "What does success look like?"

That's it. That's the secret to the course. Have a student describe specifics of what their goals are, then give them the resources to get there.
