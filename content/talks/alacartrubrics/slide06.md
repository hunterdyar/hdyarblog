Project courses are hard! Really hard!

It's hard to deal with experienced students skating by and not learning much, while other students struggle but learn more?

It's hard to get the students to pay attention to all their learning objectives, and not just focusing on the next biggest challenge in front of them?

It's hard to prevent a snowball from building for the students when they get behind.

It's hard, and time-consuming, to grade! An A and an F might be clear, but fairly deciding between B and B- for disparate projects! Oof. 

It's hard to direct students to branch out into unknowns.

It's hard on students when there are fewer grades in the course! I've had classes where the grades are all, basically, just 2 large projects. Whiff on one of those, and it's hard to get caught up.
