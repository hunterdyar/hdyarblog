Now, you can steal my rubrics. But there's no need. They're all basically the same, in this abstract way.

Each rubric is a student decomposing their project to identify a piece of it, identify a plan to tackle that piece, executing, and documenting.

Sometimes a student isn't sure which rubric they picked (was it a one-week-prototype or a-technical-proof-of-concept?). The secret is that it doesn't really matter, so long as they were able to complete these steps.

The rubrics are guiderails. They force you to go slow, have intentionality with your work ("a plan"), and document what you've done.
