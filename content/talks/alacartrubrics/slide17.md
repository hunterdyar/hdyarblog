So, here's my Grading Scale.

All the way from A to F. Two options! Satisfactory and Not Satisfactory. That's it!

It's good enough, or it isn't.

When it isn't good enough, they just take it back and fix it up. In my experience, most NS's can be turned into S's with under an hour of work. Frankly, it's usually just that they forgot some documentation when trying to get the project presentable.
