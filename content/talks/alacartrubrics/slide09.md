Here's the background context on the new course design, which I'm going to call "Production".

You can't steal this stuff, because it's probably out of your control.

I split our new class up into sections, with a major project for each section. It's basically determined by the calendar. 2-5 weeks per section.

The content cadence is weekly because we meet once a week. When I say "week", feel free to substitute whatever makes sense.

I also have all of the students provide their own learning objectives. We provide some from a co-requisite theory course, and from the course; but the students all should have a clear goal of what *extra* directions they want to go on.

For example, when I teach game design, some students want to get more into programming, or level design, or 3D modeling. This course has the flexibility to do that while still hitting all the important objectives.

I make the students right it down. This is important for later.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.
