I'm done. Just kidding, no I'm not.

Students sometimes whiff it! Or they get stuck on some random technical software update for a week and, for no good reason, are behind and struggling. That's the reality of what we're learning, but it still sucks!

*Bottom right example is a student fighting against Tobii eye-tracking terms of service*.

*Top right is a student who spent a week on research, and didn't get far. They felt bad! Had a hard time!*

Finally, I love kicking my students into the deep end. All the IMM majors, they've learned how to drown effectively. Overwhelmed with infinite technology, infinite cool projects, infinite scope. I put em through the ringer so they come out capable of the work.
But I get a non-major who hasn't had the trial-by-fire of our project-heavy program, and they are suddenly extremely low-confidence.

No matter what their experience level is, it takes work to pull students who are used to being told all the checklists and get them used to this different course structure.

Project based courses have a lot of down-sides. So let's get to how I tackled them.
