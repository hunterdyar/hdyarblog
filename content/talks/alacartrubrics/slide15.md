The actual classes? 

Well, we all know how long writing up feedback that students never read takes. So, I don't! Instead, that's most of the classes. Discussions about what the student should do next and why. What went well, what's missing, etc.

I'll talk more about feedback on the next slide.

A form in the LMS lets students submit suggestions for topics, and I observe things they are stuck on.

I've given mini-lessons on project organization, on 3D modeling workflows, on game AI, on how the internet works, on HTML/CSS basics, and more. I would never design a class like this, but the lessons come from the students; and it's what they need.
I also bring in guests to help out, covering other topics. Us Professors are still basically the best resource the students have, so I make sure to enable them to take full advantage of this resource.

Finally, work time. I have to mention it because it's one of the assessment strategies. No better way to quickly grok a student's mental model then watch them work.
