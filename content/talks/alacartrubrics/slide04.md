Although, because we have such a focus on VR/AR technologies, sometimes our showcases just look like this.

This photo just makes me laugh every time I see it. I handed a student worker a camera and wished them luck. Showcase day, we're all standing around while guests with headsets strapped to their faces try our experiences.

This is what we do. Making Immersive Media is a very interdisciplinary, very broad subject. Doing one project requires learning and executing at 50 different things and 50 different layers of abstraction.

It's a great fit for project-based courses.
