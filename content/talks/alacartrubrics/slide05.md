Now, we have these massive studio classes. Doubled-up credits, twice a week, 2.5 hours. They're great, we can dig into the weeds and do all the work!

Spoilers, one of my solves for assessment without tests is in class work time. Watching all the students work. It's hard to sacrifice class time for this... so we schedule long classes.

Well, while great for us; terrible for students who want to take, say, any other course in any other department. So to be less of a scheduling nuisance, we were asked if we could split the courses up.

So, if I had to anyway, I had a chance to sit down and design my perfect project-focused course. I made a list of all the things that are frustrating about project courses, and tried to tackle as many as I could.

This talk is the result of that effort. Welcome!
