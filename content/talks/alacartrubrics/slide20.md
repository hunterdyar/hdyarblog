Resubmissions are another huge problem with project grades. 

The problem is we can't let students get too behind (and learn good habits), balanced against giving them opportunities to fail, learn, and recover.

My personal opinion is that I never want a situation where it wouldn't be better for a student to do the work.

I don't have any late penalties, which I find feel arbitrary and punitive. I also don't have a deadline for late submissions. Instead, I simply limit the rate at which students can resubmit.

Only one resubmission per week. Two during midterms and finals. This has the same effect at forcing the

This keeps me from having to grade too much during finals, and doesn't let students build up a backlog of work for future them to handle. It's also simple to implement from a logistics perspective.

Rate-limited resubmissions! Give it a try.
