So we got a lot of rubrics to pick from!

It's decomposition and isolation.

*The right is a students mood-board for a VR heist game that took a thousand pivots*

Each of these are "a part of a project", although some of them are "other, see instructor".

The final showcase project is a prototype, but it must be demonstrated in person during a showcase. They don't get to pick that one, that's what they all do for the last week, which we call "install week".

Ever given a student great feedback... and then that was it? They had a cool idea, and there are some cool next steps, but it's time to move on? I hate that! So almost all of our projects can be continuations of previous projects.
Since the rubrics are **process** not **product**, there is always something to evalutate -- students aren't ahead or behind no matter where they are on the project.

The "iterative pass" is a rubric for, specifically, taking noted feedback and without adding new features, just hacking away on it.s

Six Sketches is another good one. 2 paper sketches, 3 sketches in the final engine/tool, and 1 sketch made with real-life things like clay or legos. Plus, only 1 sketch can revise a previous one.
