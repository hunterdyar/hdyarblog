I also need to talk about groupwork. Groupwork is a traditional massive pain for project courses. Because, they become courses in mangaging interpersonal conflict.

Not so much with this strategy. Grades are separated, but project feedback is singular. Each student has their own rubric. So the group identity and shared-evaluation anxiety is lessened without changing the fact that they have to *do* group work.

I'm also spoiled. I can combine cohorts. The 200,300, and 400 level classes are in the same room at the same time. I have second-years and graduating seniors working together. Let the leaders lead by example.

One of my favorite rubrics is "Asset Creation for Others", where one student works on another project for just one week. That one models a client relationship with an initial meeting and a feedback round meeting, with required notes from them.

I also had a group that wanted to go in 2 different directions. One students wanted horror-comedy VR, the other wanted horror-horror. They split up. That was just... allowed? If the learning objectives were for learning group-work, like it is at the 200 level, I would have intervened. But for the Seniors, they were fine. Yeah, split up. Sure! Now I get to compare similar projects and pull out design lessons!
