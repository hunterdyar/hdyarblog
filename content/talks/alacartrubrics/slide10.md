The most important question of a project course.

What are the projects?

No Clue!

We pitch them during the class. I set constraints that have to do with learning objectives, like using a new technology or engaging in design research, but they otherwise have total freedom!

Well, not *total* freedom. I'll come back to this.

An important part of my personal teaching philosophy is that students are smart, and their ideas are great. They're cooler and more awesome than any of my ideas anyway. 

I am not here to just assert ideas into their skulls (although I also do that). I think of teaching as plucking obstacles out from in front of them.
