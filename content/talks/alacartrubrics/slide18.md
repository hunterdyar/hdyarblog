There's a secret third grade item, incomplete, but that's only in the grade-book and only for me to know which students to chase down later. It's all NS.

At the 200 level, S is C- or better. 300 level, it's B- or better. 400 level, A- or better.

When I give an NS, I always list concrete and actionable reasons that it isn't good enough. This is easy because of the rubrics, it would be hard when talking about the project wholesale.

Their percentage of S's, plus section reflection papers and a participation grade, get turned into their final grade. I end up giving out lower grades than I normally would, and the students were happy with them. Grades shouldn't be surprises, and they aren't.

This was the same experience as my old colleague, Professor North Cook, had when he first used the S/NS system for a Porfolio course. I took it from him.
