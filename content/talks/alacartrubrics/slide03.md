I work in the Immersive Media Department at Chatham University.

Founded in 2019, we are young! We were modeled after the Interior Architecture program. There's a heavy focus on project-based studio courses.

We are focused on VR/AR design and development.

We're the cool intersection-of-art-and-technology kids who project cool art onto buildings.
