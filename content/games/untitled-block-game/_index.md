## About
I gave my Intro to Unity students about a week to make a video game. I took the challenge up myself and completed this in the same time period. It's a love letter to the old game, a personal favorite, Chips Challenge.

There's a lot of work I never finished, but i'm proud of this first attempt at sokabon-style games.
It's a solid start and a decent proof-of-concept.
I've taken what I learned from this game and used them in other puzzle/grid game projects, where it lives on.
