I have worked, and still occasionally freelance, as a professioanl photographer specializing in virtual reality capture, 360 photography, and image stitching.

I teach photography workshops, 1-1 lessons, and the "Pragmatic Photography" micro course at Carnegie Mellon University.

These days most of my personal photography is shooting and developing film, pulling equipment from my collection of over 100 film cameras.
