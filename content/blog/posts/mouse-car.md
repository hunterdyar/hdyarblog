## Mouse Car? Mouse Car!
Have you ever wanted to drive your mouse around the screen like a car? No? Well. Now you can anyway.

This project was made in Unity. It uses [Unity-DirectInput](https://github.com/MrTimcakes/Unity-DirectInput.git) to get data from the steering wheel, and calls to windows dll's to send [mouse clicks](https://github.com/hunterdyar/Mouse-Car/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/MouseControl.cs) and make the fullscreen, always-on-top game have a [transparent window](https://github.com/hunterdyar/Mouse-Car/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Windowless.cs).

The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/hunterdyar/Mouse-Car).

One of my student workers (@[disuko](https://www.disuko.gay/)) was paid to model the mouse car for me.
