title: Creating Random Roguelike Levels in Unity

A number of times, while making games, I find myself creating the mechanics of a rougelike - purely procedural gameplay, the same starting point, and so on.

Inevitably, I always get stuck at the same place: Level Generation.

Level generation is not new to me. I've explored it in a number of past projects. From the maze algorithm that powers [pipes](https://blooper.itch.io/pipes)...

// include images of these things.

After having projects hit that wall over and over again, I've known for a while that it was time to get something in place.

So, I started with the most reasonable way I knew: I bought someone elses' assets to use. Many where dissapointing, but [TileWorldCreator 3](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/level-design/tileworldcreator-3-199383) is excellent, and if you want a short recommendation, then just get this asset.

Yet, I work in academia, and my projects aren't just for myself, but to serve as example projects and resources for my students. So it's worth my time to try to create an open-source project of my own.
