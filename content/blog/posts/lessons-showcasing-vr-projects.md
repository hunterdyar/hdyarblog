# Lessons Learned From Showcasing Student VR Projects

VR is hard to show off: Basically, you have to go into VR.

At Chatham University, we have been hosting guests and showcasing student projects for a while, and we've learned some things along the way that I believe are worth sharing, as I believe many who work with VR may find these insights useful.

In order to do VR showcases well, there are two approaches that are both worth pursuing.  

1. You still have to do the regular showcase things well
2. Get the content out of VR in demonstratable formats
3. Get the guests (reviewers, professors, other students) into VR in quick, safe, and easy ways.

I will discuss them in order.

# Standard Showcase Lessons

1. If you don't need internet, don't use internet
2. This goes for students to. Get them to download offline copies of their Google Slides
3. Better yet, get them to stop using google slides, or anything that *requires an internet connection* to work.
4. That goes for youtube videos inside of powerpoints. Get them [offline](https://youtube-dl.org/).
5. If it's not an open house, do an introduction. Don't forget to give guests context and information about the assignment.
6. Give the guests a heads up as to what kind of advice or feedback you want them to give. In other words, let them know how harsh they are allowed or expected to be. Some professors use guests to give tough feedback while saving face in front of their long-term students they like. Is it okay to give feedback **on** the presentation, or should that be deemphasized? Some want want to broaden and diversify the kinds of feedback students will get. Be sure the guest knows! *"We brought you in here because we think your experience doing set design for theater will be useful for students."*
7. Write up a schedule and post it, if possible. Choose student order ahead of time. I usually just ask the students what order they want to go in, but decide the whole thing at the top of class, don't continuously ask "Who wants to go next?"
8. Set timers and discussion time-limits. Telling people to "wrap up soon" is hard, but flashing a phone that has a big full-screen clock running is easy and passive, and can have the presenters/guests naturally wrapping up without breaking flow.
9. Set the tone. Casual? Formal? It's your job to make sure students and guests know what the appropriate etiquette and expectations are. Easiest way to do is it just be stating it. No really, just say! "Welcome! These are informal, but graded presentations where..." Of course, simultaneously lead by example.

Okay, but none of that is why you are reading this post. I run VR and AR showcases. But if you're already doing showcases well, then you will probably be fine, barring inevitable technical headaches.

## Showcasing Student VR Work Outside of VR.

I can summarize this section rather quickly: **Require Documentation From Students**.

### Teach Documentation Indirectly

Documentation is hard! While you may not have time to lead a lecture on video editing or quality video capture, there are some things we have done that have worked well.

First, I find teaching digital media skills useful, so long as I am covering them through the lens of techniques and principles, and not "these are the steps to memorize for documentation". In my Introduction To Immersive Media course, I teach basic how-audio-works and audio editing in Audacity. While the course moves on to learning Blender, I choose that moment to include a brief splash demonstration of trimming video and how - hey, look, it's basically the same thing. I don't actually teach the students how, or the software UI. I just demonstrate the similarities between the skills we just focused on, and how they can be applied to video.

My goal here isn't to teach video, it's to lower the barrier or lack of confidence a student has to teaching themselves these tools. After learning so much else in the digital media space, my students will likely be fairly comfortable trimming a video, so long as they've at least *tried*.

Another example of teaching documentation indirectly, is when running an in-class exercise where we got our previous 3D space assignments running in VR. Right then, in the workshop time, I included taking a photos/videos with the built in Oculus tools, and pulling those files off of the headset. While I didn't hide my intentions for including this in the workshop, it was clearly not the goal of the assignment. Again, forcing students to do things they would otherwise not have confidence trying, so they can learn and experiment on their own.

### Show Off Student Work Passively

Documentation for the sake of documentation is never as good as documentation for specific screens of events. I don't believe the students are *lazy*, but that they need to be able to visualize a third party looking at them. Having a display cycling through student work will help them, very literally, imagine how they should be documenting their work.

Students see it, but they also see *documentation*, and it's a nice thing to point to. Plus, just directly asking "Hey, student, could you take some nicer screenshots and email them to me? I want to put that project up on the wall" is also a plus.

### Grade The Documentation Instead of The Project

This doesn't work for all projects, but in some cases, I make it very clear that I am grading the students documentation of their work, and not their work directly. It's a strange thing for students to get used to, and many balk at the philosophy of it, but it's extremely effective. Learning about how to present, discuss, and talk about ones work is important!

For these projects, I have students also submit screenshots of their editor windows/hierarchies for academic integrity purpsoses.

### Require a Video Recording

Tell them it's a backup plan for when everything breaks the day of the demo. A colleague requires video capture for his students weekly project reports, which is something I will absolutely adopt moving forward. A demo I was a guest for starting going poorly when a laptop died, and the student presenting (on a different laptop) casually flipped to the next slide and showed a video instead, barely missing a beat. Color me impressed.

## Running a Student Showcase

### Setup  VR Ahead of Time

They day I stop having to watch someone walk through a vive room-scale setup will be a good day. Get that set up ahead of time! Oculus Quest is getting *better* at remembering play spaces... at least give yourself the chance that it will work.

One great way to minimize setup time:

### Don't Swap Headsets

At our program, every student in our program get's a headset. Currently, these headsets are Oculus Quest 2's. Final projects are, more or less, the .apk files.

I have a handful of extra Quest 2's for running demos, and I get these updated and sanitized before the event. Then I download all of the apk files (so a submission deadline before the showcase is important) and load the headsets up. Each guest reviewer gets a headset, so they **don't have to swap facial interfaces**, and **never put a students headset on**. I adopted stricter sanitization policies when coming back from COVID-19 Quarantine, and I am not sure I want to go back. It also helps guests feel comfortable, and prevents us from re-drawing guardian boundries constantly. It's very low friction to switch between projects.

The biggest downside is getting the students to name their projects well! Suddenly, the **app Identifier** becomes really important.

> "Yeah, head to unknown sources, now look for com.DefaultCompany.Final_Project. Ours is the one with the underscore."

"DefaultCompany" has become something of a running joke in the department.

//todo: include screencap of quest with all those damn comdots on it lol.

## Casting Do's and Dont's

### Wired > Wireless

If possible, run experiences off of a computer, and let the screen be a screenshare. Oculus link tends to be more reliable than wireless casting, and while the Oculus/Facebook account connection isn't as bad as it used to be, it still puts a sour taste in my mouth asking students to log into any non-personal device with a Facebook account.

### Beware Bandwidth

The unexpected downside of casting is local bandwidth and wireless interference. I have discovered, even on robust campus networks, that there is a limit to the number of Quests we can get casting at the same time without losing a lot of bitrate. In my space, I try not to do more than two wirelessly at once, just to be safe.

### Use Experienced Demonstrators

If a guest is in VR, that's great! We love that.

But if it's a student showcasing, then these students are no longer 'playtesting', they're actors! Unless the showcase is for naive guests, the one in VR should be practiced and prepared. Show the students (just take a video of them + the casting screen in VR) what it looks like from the non-VR side of the presentation, so they can learn they really need to center objects on their vision, move their head slower, talk through what they are doing with their hands, do dances/gestures with their hands in front of their face, and all the other little tips that we've all picked up for "performing" VR.

### Masking Tape

Don't forget the golden rule of VR:

> If you get punched by someone in VR, it's your fault!

Crowded showcases, unfamiliar guests, and non-standard play-space setups are perfect recipe for an unfortunate accident.

My rule of thumb is: If we are ever showcasing for even one "outside" guest who is inexperienced with VR, then we must make our play spaces visible outside of VR. Luckily for us, we got custom carpet patterns installed in our studio, so we have pre-existing & permanent, play space areas. We just have to tell the guests to make note of them.

### Tracking Success

Get the lighthouses up HIGH and use more than you usually need. There's going to be people standing in front of them! If you move any monitors, be sure to test your setups - those big glass TV screens aren't great for Vive Lighthouses and can be a pain for Quest tracking too.

Often showcases involve a bug shuffle and reorganization of a space, and new obstacles to tracking may be introduced. Don't forget to test!

> While cleaning for the showcase, we opened the blinds for the first time in 4 months and now all the tracking is wonky! Students can't figure out why and will panic. It's an easy thing to overlook!
