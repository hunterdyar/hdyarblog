NOTE: just move this to guidebook

File browsers - that's going to be Explorer on windows and Finder on Mac - are staples of the operating system. They also don't work very well, and are a constant point of pain and frustration for my students. What can we do about it?

> I'm not here to cast blame or say *why* things are the way they are. But two big culprits are web services like  iCloud, Google Docs, and Microsoft OneDrive trying to give us a "unified" experience, and tablets/mobile design motifs making their way into desktop operating systems. 

This is not an exploration as to *why* file browsrs are so unusable, it's just a write-up of all the strategies and techniques to use file browsers that I find myself teaching students over and over again.
