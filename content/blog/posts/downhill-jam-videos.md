title: Downhill Jam - Using Inheiritance in Unity Follow-along Video Series

I recorded the following video series as an assignment for my programming class, accompanying other projects where they getting introduced to polymorphism in C#. This project is a follow-along demonstration of, in a "real" game, some of these code architecture techniques in action.

The first part just sets up the Car Controller. This is the type of thing I would consider skipping, and providing the starter project and sample assets to the students. I took the opportunity to solve an interesting problem with vectors and dot products, and demonstrate the workflow - structuring the *rest* of the project to isolate the challenging bit into it's own little area.

The second and third parts, doing Interaction and UI Panels, are the real heart of the project.
