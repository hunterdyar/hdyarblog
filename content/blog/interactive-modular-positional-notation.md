I created an interactive exolainer for Positional Notation, aiming to teach the underlying principles of Binary and Hexadecimal notation.

[https://explainers.hdyar.com/binary/index.html](https://explainers.hdyar.com/binary/index.html).

This is a text/image lecture with interactive JavaScript toys, and a video that also walks users through some of the core concepts. In addition, I have taken the JavaScript toys and broken them off to their own webpages, like this [color picker](https://explainers.hdyar.com/standalone/color.html). The rest are linked on the [main page](https://explainers.hdyar.com/).

## Modular Educational Resources

For the students that are likely to zone out while reading a wall of text, I also made to sure to cover the most important topics in a video. I didn't want to just make another version of the same lesson. Instead, my goal is to create a set of resources that could be taken all together, or used independently. The video, the web page, and the standalone JavaScript toys are all independently accessible and usable by students. I can teach by bringing the toys up fullscreen, or having students try them during an in-class exercise.

I could assign the videos, or just use them for students who miss class.

I hope most students will use a little of everything, but this modular approach to academic resource development allows me to not redevelop resources when I switch lesson plans, and so on.
